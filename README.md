## Cinema Ticketing System
#### This project used the C++ program to perform the tasks for the ticketing process. 
#### TAR Cinemax shows a popular movie every Friday night. The cinema is open to the public but any students who shows their student registration card can get a cheaper ticket rate.
#### The management of the TAR Cinemax has developed a simple Ticketing Program that will issue tickets for the upcoming movie of the week. It also provides a report on the ticket sales for the movie.
#### The cinema venue has three classes of seat with different ticket prices for different categories. Customer who arrive at the ticket counter will be shown the list of available seats and they will be asked which Category, Class and ticket quantity for each category they require. If the selected seats are not available, the system will prompt the customers to enter again. Then, the customers also will be asked if they want to add on Popcorn Combo which is very worthy. 
#### 	Other than that, the customers can choose their payment method and enjoy 10% off if they choose to pay with Boost e-wallet. After payment has been made, each customer will be issued a ticket showing the movie tittle, seat no. and showing time and others.
#### 	Finally, all the customers will be served at the ticket counter until all the seats are sold, no more customers. A Ticket Sales and Popcorn Combo report will then be produced for the management.
